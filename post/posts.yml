  body: "<p>I've been thinking about this over the past few years. The type of work I like to do and excel at tending to fall into a very specific portion of a project, and I found the further along a project got, the less efficient my time was and the less value I&nbsp;was producing. In contrast, the earlier I&nbsp;was into a project, the more efficient and valuable my contributions have been. </p><p>Recently I've been trying to align myself more with a role I've tentatively been calling Vision Design. I haven't spent much time yet researching what else is out there related to this term or how others use it yet, as I first want to process for myself what this means.‍</p><p>So here we go—Let's dive in and see what we find.</p><p>First, I'm writing this through the lens of someone that has worked under the title of \"Product Designer\" for the past 5 years. At Facebook we don't use level signifiers (senior, junior, principal, staff, etc) and like to call ourselves a flat organization (I have thoughts on this, but I digress.) The idea here is that everyone's contributions are equally valued—younger designers (experience wise) should have the chance to contribute equally as those with more experience. This is valuable to help people grow, and I personally experienced the value here as I had the chance to drive major projects myself (likely over my head even.)</p><p>The downside here is because everyone has the same role, generalists tend to do better than specialists because most projects are essentially owning an entire product or vertical. This is great for building a wide range of skills early, but as designers progress in their career they tend to specialize, and these specializations are often not rewarded equally. </p><p>In a metrics-based project environment like Facebook, specializations like designer/pm hybrids, systems designers align really well with the way projects work here. On the flip side, specialties like visual design, design engineering/prototyping &amp; focuses on long range vision tend not to align as well with the way designers are rewarded. Sure, these things are seen as valuable, but people that want to do these things full time have a hard time finding a place, or continually find they are not measured equally with their peers.</p><p>I remember one of my peers being frustrated with their review one half. They were asked to lean heavily into long range vision in a long sprint and a series of follow up projects. They then were penalized at the end of the half, because they had not shipped enough work publicly/moved important internal metrics.</p><p>All of this means that people often end up in one of three categories: 1) an extremely experienced generalist, 2) moving to a manager track to progress in their career (even if they don't want manage people), or 3) leaving the company to find a place they can specialize the way they want.</p>"

  body: "<p><em>Chapter One —</em></p><p><em>Everyone has felt that creeping feeling. The feeling that you just couldn’t possibly belong. That somehow you are here by mistake. It’s terrifying because it feels </em><strong><em>true</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p>There is a voice inside of me. One that constantly tells me that I don’t belong. The truth is, sometimes I believe that voice.</p><p>The impostor is there to remind me of the things I’m afraid to say. <em>You are not a real designer. You just got lucky. You are not as talented as your peers.</em> Even while I read stories of many great people who have struggled with Impostor Syndrome, I wonder if I can really compare my feelings to what their experiences.</p><p>My struggles with self value make me feel like I’m not meant to be here.</p><p>In my early years of post-secondary education I struggled greatly with Impostor Syndrome. I didn’t enjoy my classes as I felt like I was learning more on my own, and yet, I saw the skill gap between my friends and I widen. That gap became a chasm. I no longer belonged, and missed out on many opportunities.</p><p>I was afraid to apply to internships, and unwilling to leave my job to search for something more challenging. I was afraid I was already working over my level and would not be able to find something else. I didn’t seek mentorship because I feared that my lack of skills would be exposed.</p><p><em>Afraid, afraid, afraid.</em></p><h2>The crippling fear that impostor syndrome brings can leave you in a hole that feels like you just can’t get out of.</h2><p>Well — I’m here to tell you that there is hope. You are <strong>not</strong> an impostor.</p><p>You did not end up here by accident.</p><p>You don’t have to give in to the voice in your head, and here is how you are going to prove it:</p><ul><li><strong>Trust others. </strong><em>Trust that they know what they are doing. You were hired for this job for a reason. You made it into that school for a reason. By doubting yourself you are doubting everyone involved in the process. And for the people that trusted you, create something good!</em></li><li><strong>Break the cycle. </strong><em>Every time you feel like you don’t belong reflect on your accomplishments. Tell yourself that you do belong, and that you are here for a reason. Take joy in finding what that reason is and working towards accomplishing it.</em></li><li><strong>Challenge yourself</strong>.<em> Don’t shy away from a problem or learning a skill because it takes you out of your comfort zone. You deserve to contribute. Let the world know what you want to say.</em></li><li><strong>Confide in others. </strong><em>You might be surprised at how many people feel the same way. Encourage each other. Sometimes simply verbalizing your thoughts can help you see things differently.</em></li><li><strong>Be confident. </strong><em>Don’t place your value in other’s opinions of you. Even the positive opinions of others can cripple your self confidence. Julie Zhou said it best in her article </em><a href=\"https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-imposter-syndrome-9e23e2326d88#.aecfyy60n\">The Impostor Syndrome</a>: <em>“Experience makes anything look easy, but insecurities never fully disappear… [however] it gets easier. You start trusting yourself. You’re an imposter less and less, and you’re yourself more and more.”</em></li></ul><p>When the voice inside you starts whispering, remember that you are here for a reason. You were not chosen by mistake.</p><p>You worked hard, struggled long and now you have made it to the place you belong.</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>"

  body: "<p>After I wrapped up my period of deep exploration I wrote up some of what I&nbsp;discovered and created these posters.</p><p>Poster text:</p><h2>1. Design = Making</h2><p><br></p><h3><strong><em>WHAT IS CUUUBIC?</em></strong></h3><p>It is a project about exploring new techniques and ways of making. Rather than starting with a problem and trying to solve it, I chose a concept and started making things and exploring to find what I could discover. It was a very freeing process.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Why CUUUBIC?</strong></h3><p>From the beginning I started working with voxels, which is a 3D pixel, or a cube. I needed a simple name to categorize everything under, so I thought it was suitable.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>What was the work made in?</strong></h3><p>I experimented with quite a few technologies, but the primary ones used were Photoshop, Illustrator, Blender, Maya and a program called MagicaVoxel.</p><p><br></p><h3><em>Making to find a problem (and yourself.)</em></h3><p><br></p><p>Design as making is the idea of finding a problem through exploration, rather than starting with a problem using it to design a solution. Starting from a pre-existing problem may limit exploration, whereas starting right from making makes it easier to explore without the burden of fitting a solution. The conclusions found through making can be fluid, changing as further making brings to light new ideas. The process of making work can become the work itself. Through creating a body of work you can begin to discover meaning and a voice.<br></p><p>A designer creates value by making work. The quality of the work will be judged by individuals and the design community as a whole, but good or bad each piece of work builds on who the designer is as a whole. The value mentioned here isn’t monetary value or how good the design is, it is the work’s place in the voice of the designer overall.<br></p><h2>2. The Project</h2><p>\t</p><p>\tStep into a world of intense color and imagination gone wild. Cuuubic is an exploration of color and space and the relationship between 3D objects. The work goes beyond a generated image and takes the viewer on a journey through the beautiful spaces that color, light and material generate when interacting. Shadow and reflection amplify these spaces, often creating textures or colors completely different than the original objects have. The project focused on exploration and design as a process. Exploration wasn’t limited to only creating visual work, but exploring a vast amount of tools, using varied techniques and experimenting with the possibilities of materials, the way the light moves, and the way reflections interact. Not every avenue taken was successful but the failures lead the way to a process that created many visually stunning results. In employing a wide and deep process I hoped to discover a voice that would resonate with both myself and the audience. Through sharing my work with others I’ve become that guy that makes art with cubes and things, which speaks to the voice that I’ve begun to create.</p><p><em>\t</em>The work can be described as imagination gone wild (but not that wild.) It explores color and space and the relationship between objects. The interesting part of the work goes beyond just the image generated. It is the play between the objects, materials and reflections. Shadows and reflections form that bring out new color and shapes created by the interaction of materials and light. The length of the project was short, so I focused my exploration on exploring those interactions. Through sharing my work with others I’ve become that makes art with cubes and things, which I think speaks to the idea of making being part of defining a voice. The work matters because it shows the results of my making and research, a step toward creating a voice and exploration into a territory of design I have not stepped before.<br></p><h2>3. Selfish Design</h2><p><br></p><p>\t<em>Or how the project became personal without it meaning to.</em><br></p><h2>4. Complexity vs Impact</h2><p>\t</p><p>\t<em>MORE COMPLEX DOESN’T MEAN MORE EFFECTIVE</em></p><p><br></p><p><em>\t</em>I started this project wanting to explore the concept of worlds, either digital or imaginary. Something that doesn’t exist in our own world, beyond what we see in our everyday lives, like an alternate reality. I spent a lot of time working with more realistic (non-abstract) imagery like landscapes, but I found they took a long time to create a single piece, which stopped me from creating work rapidly and exploring multiple ideas. The also needed to feel believable, which changed the type of reaction the audience had when viewing them. By working with simple shapes like cubes and rectangles I could build a variety of simple to moderately complex environments very quickly, which allows time to explore in the rendering phase, which is usually where the magic happens.</p><p><em>\t</em>The joy of working in 3D tools versus traditional tools like Photoshop or Illustrator is that the compositions can be rotated and manipulated in 3D, which often returns interesting and unexpected results. This process greatly aids discovery through making. I would love to return to making more complex pieces, as I think they are great at communicating a specific feeling, but for now the time investment wouldn’t allow me to work as effectively<br></p><h2>5. Tools are just tools</h2><p>\t</p><p>\t<em>Learning new things is great but can get in the way of making.</em><br></p><h2>6. Who came before you?</h2><p><br></p><p>\t<em>Finding others who have done work similar to yours can help you understand where your work belongs.</em><br></p><h2>7. What is the message? (What did I find?)</h2><p><br></p><p>\t<em>Making is good, but making for a reason is better.</em></p><p><br></p><p>I started exploring if I could discover a connection between color and an observer’s emotional response. I examined topics like how emotion and color are related, what kind of emotions certain kinds of colors gave off, and if people reacted to the same piece differently. From my observations different color schemes give off very different feels. Softer colors and materials give a calm, warm and soft feeling. Darker colors and reflective materials in dark light give off cooler and more serious emotion. Dull colors and rough textures feel old and worn, uninspired and even depressing. The theme of connecting color and emotion seemed very obvious to me, and without testing against users or doing additional research to improve upon this theory I wasn’t going to make much progress with it. I realized that I was still in the early phases on my exploration, and likely should not have taken such an open-ended approach with a project that has such a short deadline. <br>As I continued making I began to notice details that were not planned, but became the central themes to the work. Details like a new color being created in a reflection, or two shapes combining because of the perseptive the image is rendered at. These “happy accidents” became the focus of my project as further pursued the interaction in the spaces between the colors and shapes I had chosen. In my most recent work I’ve tried to continue to explore these interactions and create work that would allow me to share them clearly. I believe that with time for further exploration I could isolate more clearly the message I want to convey with these pieces, but for now I continue to explore and create in hope of a revelation.<br></p><h2>8. Don’t give up on an idea before you have made anything.</h2><p><br></p><p>\t<em>The Blank Canvas Effect can be terrifying, don’t let it stop you for creating.</em></p><p><br></p><p>\t“One of the things that I think holds me back is a fear of creating or writing things that are bad. Once something is made it feels so permanent, and that is terrifying to me.”</p><p><br></p>"

  body: "_INTRO WIP_\n\nFirst, we'll take a look at all the gear you might want to set up your desk. If you already have everything, you can jump straight to [the setup](#the-setup).\n\n## The Gear\n\nI've compiled together a list of all the high quality desk/work from home gear I've used or know of in one place (so you don't have to waste money on things that are not great!) This is the list I wish I had when I started building my setup!\n\nThese will skew towards the higher price range in these categories, but I'll try to include any budget options I know that are solid, or I've personally tested. Generally, I'm looking at a balance of quality, aesthetic and price range. I'll try to call out anything in this list that I haven't personally owned or used.\n\n### Computer\n\nYou probably already have on of these, but in case you are shopping around, here is what I recommend in 2021.\n\n##### Macs\n\n[Macbook Air M1](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air)\n\nThis is a beast of a machine, and the new M1 chip seems to be more or less living up to it's hype. This is a great machine for most things – If you don't need to be running productivity or content creation software (Adobe, video editing, etc) you probably don't need much more than this. Be aware that the SSDs in these machines can't be upgraded, so you will need to buy the size you need up front.\n\nNote: If you plan to have more than one monitor, or to run a monitor at 4K, I'd think about moving up to a...\n\n[Macbook Pro](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/)\n\nThese days, it isn't really worth moving up to a Macbook Pro unless you are doing some heavy creation work. Even design work can be done completely on the above M1 Air due to Figma and other web tools coming on to the scene. If you do need an MBP, don't buy a model made between 2016-2020 (these have the terrible [older MBP keyboards](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-designA).)\n\n[iMac](https://www.apple.com/imac/)\n\nIf you don't need to be on the go with your machine, and want to combine in a monitor, iMacs are great. I honestly my good old iMac all the time.\n\nIf an iMac sounds good I'd maybe recommend waiting though, as I imagine we'll likely get an [iMac refresh](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/) pretty soon.\n\n##### PC – Laptop\n\nThese move so fast it is hard to keep up with. If you are looking to buy a laptop, I recommend [Dave2D's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVYamHliCI9rw1tHR1xbkfw) channel. He covers most notable ones in a straightforward and unbiased way. Otherwise, when in doubt, usually the [XPS 13](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-laptop/spd/xps-13-9310-laptop) is a good bet. Generally, [Razer Blades](https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade) have a good track record, but they are a bit more hit or miss than the XPS 13.\n\n##### PC – Desktop\n\nGenerally your best bet will be to [put together a machine yourself](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-build-pc-ultimate-step-step-guide), but in 2021 this is a bit of a tall ask due to shortages being everywhere.\n\nI picked up [one of these](https://www.zotac.com/us/product/mini_pcs/magnus-one-ecm73070c-barebone) recently for our living room – it's an awesome little powerhouse (that makes a lot of noise.) Noise seems to be unimportant to some people, and the most important thing to others. Make sure you do your research here on how much noise a PC will make if that matters to you, and probably avoid really small machines unless you are willing to get your hands dirty to bring down the volume.\n\nThe main thing to remember with PCs: smaller = more money, faster = more money, high end = mostly for bragging rights. Use a tool like [logical increments](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) to find the right price/performance ratio for you.\n\nOther desktop resources: [PC Part Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) | [SFF Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/)\n\n### Monitor\n\n[LG UltraFine 5K](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D24BQBQ/) – LG\n\n~850-1,299 (Price varies by sales + New vs Refurbished) – [Price History](https://camelcamelcamel.com/LG-UltraFine-Monitor-MacBook-Renewed/product/B07D24BQBQ)\n\nNot sure what the poor reviews are about here – I bought mine out of pocket (refurbished), I've been driving this monitor for 3 years now and it's been solid. If you are using a Mac, use your laptop open with a monitor, and on-screen color matters then this is the best option.\n\nOptions open up a bit more if you are willing to have non-OSX native color (this isn't overly noticeable as long as you don't use your laptop open, or are using a desktop like a Mac Mini.)\n\n[BenQ EW3270U](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078HWBGH5/) (32\", 4K) – BenQ\n\nMatte display, super large. I've daily drove these for a few years now, and own two of them. IMO two of these are too big for a desk. If you want something pretty solid and are ok with slightly muted colors these are a pretty good place to start. You probably want to arm mount these. (Make sure you are ok with how big they are.)\n\n#### Even Bigger?\n\nOnce you get over the 32\" range you have two general directions you can go:\n\nThe first: Moving to an Ultrawide.\n\nThese are essentially 1.5-2 monitors side by side in a single monitor. They are great for working on multiple things at once, multiple code windows open at once or playing games in a wide aspect ratio.\n\nThe second: Moving up to a TV.\n\nIn the past, TVs had pretty atrocious input lag, and often couldn't match resolutions with higher end monitors since they are meant to be viewed from a distance. More recently, in gaming mode good TVs tend to have great response times and the resolution to match.\n\nIf you go this route, I'd consider mounting the TV on the wall behind your desk, or having a very deep desk. TVs are HOT and very bright. Using a TV for a long time sitting a short distance from your face will likely give you some serious eye strain.\n\nRegardless of which route you go, I'd recommend using some sort of window management software ([OSX](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-mac-window-management-tools/) | [Windows](https://www.slant.co/topics/1249/~best-window-managers-for-windows)) at screen sizes this large. Programs don't tend to utilize this amount of space very well, so being able to set up quadrants is really helpful.\n\nI use [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) on OSX generally.\n\nSmaller monitor for VC\n\nI don't have a specific recommendation here, as most of these are from generic brands, but having a small (13~15\") portable monitor for second screen things like music, as well as a dedicate VC is pretty handy. Ideally one with VESA compatible mounting holes is ideal (like [this](https://www.banggood.com/PORPOISE-HT-1330XT-13_3-Inch-1080P-Type-C-Portable-Computer-Monitor-Gaming-Display-Screen-for-Smartphone-Tablet-Laptop-Game-Consoles-p-1666109.html?p=1D22009628395201703K&custlinkid=1507010&cur_warehouse=CN) one) so you can put it on a monitor arm or VESA stand. Your webcam/mic/etc can also sit on top of this to get a better angle.\n\nSomething like a [Portal](https://portal.facebook.com/products/) can also work here if you want a flexible dedicated calling device. Downside: Not mountable. (Disclaimer: I've worked for Facebook.)\n\n### Monitor Stands, Arms & Risers\n\n[Wood Desk Shelf](https://grovemade.com/product/wood-desk-shelf/?initial=342) – [Grovemade](https://grovemade.com/)\n\n[Wood Laptop Riser](https://grovemade.com/product/wood-laptop-riser/?initial=622) – [Grovemade](https://grovemade.com/)\n\nI'll bundle these together, but overall Grovemade has excellent desktop accessories, including stands. The desk shelf will comfortably fit 2 large-ish monitors (~27in), and you can slide your keyboard or laptop underneath.\n\nThe laptop riser adds quite a bit of height, so you would want this to sit beside a monitor, and a keyboard/mouse–not use it full time.\n\nThe quality of Grovemade products overall are top tier, and I know a lot of people that have these. You probably won't regret investing in these.\n\nThese are what I use on my desk today.\n\n### Keyboard\n\n[Das Professional 4 Keyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional-for-mac/) – [daskeyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/)\n\nPrice: $169\n\nThis keyboard checks all the boxes for me – Not visually loud, has quite options for mechanical keys, physical knob for volume, media controls... You get the picture. The one thing that would make this keyboard perfect for me is a mic mute button, but I know that is asking a lot. I use the Cherry MX brown version, but if you want something louder/more clicky you can go with Blues.\n\nThis keyboard also has a [Windows version](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional/), and a [blank key version](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-ultimate/).\n\n[Generic Brand Mechanical](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E8KO2B0/)\n\nPrice: ~$30-50\n\nA super budget option – I was pretty impressed with this keyboard, Great form factor. Keys are mushy, so if that bugs you I would avoid this one. I actually like the feel of these keys over many higher-end mechanical keyboards. I'd expect a 1-2 year lifespan out of something like this, and no support if something goes wrong.\n\n### Mouse\n\nMice are highly based on preference, like keyboards, so I'll just share what I have used.\n\n[Razer Death Adder](https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/Razer-DeathAdder-V2/RZ01-03210100-R3U1) – Razer\n\nPrice: ~$50-$130 (Depends on wireless, buttons, etc.)\n\nA solid daily driver – Some people rag on Razer but I've been using one model or another of the death adder since 2008 and they have always served me well. I'd expect to replace these every 2-3 years (the build is solid, but they often end up double clicking randomly later in their life, similar to a common issue with Logitech mice.)\n\n##### Specialized\n\nSpaceMouse Pro 3D – 3DConnexion\n\nThis mouse is for 3D work primarily – if you do a lot of 3D modeling, and can get used to the idea of physically navigating 3D space, this will be a HUGE time saver for you. I never could get into the right mental mode to navigate like this, but I was very impressed with the device itself.\n\nMacro Pads (Example: [Razer Tartarus](https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Tartarus-Progammable-Detachable-Mecha-Membrane/dp/B07754PYFK/))\n\nThere is a huge variety of these, but if your workflow would benefit for a place to map macros, these could be useful. I haven't use this specific one, but in my experience Razer's software for mapping macros is pretty straight forward.\n\n### Mousepads & Desk Covers\n\nI haven't found my perfect mouse pad yet, but I tend to prefer large, desk cover style ones that the keyboard also sits on. This avoids the awkwardness and physical wear of dragging your arm over the edge of the mouse pad occasionally, and also looks better. I've bought a few of these from Amazon in the past few years, but nothing has really stood out.\n\nI'll probably try one of these next:\n\n[Matte Desk Pad](https://grovemade.com/product/matte-desk-pad/?initial=534) – Grovemade\n\nI haven't owned this particular desk pad, but I feel comfortable enough with Grovemade's other products to recommend this one blind. I'd personally avoid the wool ones, I have one of those and I tend to find it a bit scratchy on the skin while mousing around but YMMV.\n\n[Orbitkey Desk Mat](https://www.orbitkey.com/collections/orbitkey-desk-mat/products/orbitkey-desk-mat?variant=32750570471520) – Orbitkey\n\nPrice: $65\n\nI haven't owned this one either, but it looks pretty solid, and the cable holder is a big plus to me.\n\n### Audio\n\n[Airpods](https://www.apple.com/shop/select-airpods)/[Airpods Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP22AM/A/airpods-pro) – Apple\n\nPrice: $149/$249\n\nI've tried a ton of headphones, and honestly, for meetings and passive listening, nothing really beats the Airpods. Obviously sound quality isn't the priority here, but the device switching convenience and auto pause when removing a single side is great. I prefer the shape of the regular Airpods over the pros, and actually prefer that they don't noise cancel. If you need noise cancelling to work, go with the Pros.\n\nI don't really use the wireless charging case, but it probably isn't needed if you are on a budget.\n\n[AT ATH-M50X](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVLUR86/) – Audio-Technica\n\nPrice: ~$120\n\nThe classic. You probably know at least one person with pair of headphones or have seen someone on TV wearing them, and for a good reason. These are great, solid, unoffensive headphones. \"Neutral\" describes their sound well. If you need something reasonably priced, and high quality, these is a good place to start. There are tons of detailed reviews on the amazon page, so I won't write much more here. (Note: Some people in the reviews recommend trying after-market ear cups on these. I haven't done this on either pair of these that I have, but could be good to look in to.)\n\nThere is apparently a bluetooth version of these available now – I can't speak to them but they might be worth trying out.\n\n[WH-1000XM3](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3) – Sony\n\nPrice: $349\n\nThese are the ones I own – I'm not sure why the XM4s are both cheaper (~$250) and have worse reviews, but these are pretty good. (Gross note: These ear cups tend to gather sweat a decent amount when worn for a few hours.)\n\nWhile I bought these for working at my desk, the real place they shine is on long flights. With the noise cancelling on you basically forget anyone else is on the plane with you. It more or less completely removes cabin noise.\n\nOverall, if you are just using these as desk headphones, I'd go either cheaper and wired, or with the Airpod Pros.\n\n[Uppr Zero headphone stand](https://gouppercase.com/products/zero).\n\nI don't own this one, but this is a pretty unique & beautiful headphone stand with an all aluminum build.\n\n### Video\n\n##### Lower End\n\n[Logitech C922 Pro](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c922-pro-stream-webcam.960-001087.html?crid=34) – [Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/webcams)\n\n~$100\n\nThis is a pretty unoffensive option for a starter webcam. For most cases, this will give you an upgrade to your video and audio quality without breaking the bank.\n\nAlso promising:\n\n[Software](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epoccam-webcam-for-mac-and-pc/id449133483) + A Phone\n\nThis is becoming a more popular option, and the results are pretty good. You can get high quality video out of your phone that you might already have. It can be a bit of a hassle to set up and take down your phone daily, but it is an option.\n\n[Moment](https://www.shopmoment.com/) has also been kicking off a promising [Magsafe line](https://www.shopmoment.com/magsafe) for mounting. This might be helpful with this type of approach.\n\n##### Higher End\n\nDSLR/Mirrorless + Capture Card\n\nPrice: *~$300 all the way to tens of thousands*\n\nWhat most people you see with \"amazing\" looking video quality/youtube videos are using. There are _way_ to many options to get into here. I'm in the Sony ecosystem, so I'd recommend something like the a5100, a6300~ or Alpha 7C (these range from ~300-1.7k)\n\nI'll link to [a post like this](https://www.epiphan.com/blog/best-cameras-for-live-streaming/) and let you dive in further.\n\n[Pi HD Cam](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) – [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)\n\nThis is a pretty cool + hacker friendly option. The lenses it uses are inexpensive CCTV lenses as well. I'm hoping to write up a post on creating a VC setup using the Raspberry Pi at some point, so I'll revisit this then!\n\n### Accessories\n\n[CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt 3 Dock](https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/) – [CalDigit](https://www.caldigit.com/)\n\n(~$230+)\n\nIf you buy a single high end accessory for your desk, this is the one I would recommend.\n\nFlawless connectivity across multiple monitors, high quality USB, card reader and full power even for 16\" 100W Macbook Pros. I've used my for the past 4 years and I've never had a single issue with it, and know at least 15 people who all have had a similar experience. This is the baseline for high quality tech.\n\n(I've read some reports of people having issues with these and their Macbook Pros. I was surprised to hear this, as I know many, many people with these that have never had any issues, but once again YMMV.)\n\nCaldigit has a few other options these days for docks – you can see if a different one meets your needs better, but I do recommend something with it's own power source, not something that pulls power from the laptop.\n\nOverall, if the price doesn't put it completely out of your budget, this is a really solid building block for your desk setup.\n\n[Under desk volume knob and macro keyboard](https://www.pikatea.com/collections/products/products/pikatea-macropad-gb2).\n\nI haven't had a chance to try this yet, but I've been looking to buy something like this for years. The keys act as a bindable macro keyboard, and the knob works by default for volume and mute/unmute. Looking forward to picking one of these up to see if I can turn it into hardware remote for Video Conferencing.\n\n[Yeelight – LED Light Bar Pro](https://en.yeelight.com/product/1512.html).\n\nThis sits on top of your monitor and illuminates the whole desk surface evenly without adding glare to the monitor. I plan on buying this model, so I'll update this once I try it myself.\n\n### Chair\n\n_Seating WIP_\n\n### Wifi/Networking\n\nEthernet\n\nIf you don't have a dock with Ethernet, at least some sort of small USB-C to Ethernet dongle is a must have ([Example cheap on](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VPMPT6M/)e, I have this one and it works fine.)\n\n### Extras\n\nI haven't tried any of the below, but I'll here are some of the things I'm interested in checking out next.\n\n[Grommet USB Hub](https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Desk-USB-HUB/dp/B0863KCTFZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=orico%2Bdesk%2Bgrommet&qid=1603851450&sr=8-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=minimalistik-20&linkId=5c5001a8363b68a8e6217aed8ba31bc6&language=en_US&th=1) – Generic\n\nThis is a pretty cool idea – I already use grommet holes to run cables from the top of my desk to the bottom, adding a hub here for things like headphones and quick USB access is pretty handy.\n\nCorsair iCUE LT100 – Corsair\n\nAccent Lighting\n\nCustom Cables\n\nA store like [this](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CustomCableCo)\n\n## The Setup\n\nAudio Input (Microphone)\n\nhttps://medium.com/macoclock/how-in-the-bleep-do-i-mute-my-mic-anywhere-on-macos-d2fa1185b13\n\n## General Thoughts\n\n### Buying from Amazon\n\nIf you have a shopping history with them, buy though Amazon where possible. Their customer support generally will fix problems no questions asked, and often on lower priced items not even have you send them back Always look for the Prime tag, avoid buying from Amazon Marketplace accounts or items tagged \"Fulfilled by Amazon.\"\n\nExpect buying through Amazon you will eventually get a returned item.\n\n### Credit Card Perks\n\nThis really depends on what you have access to, but a high end credit card like a [Sapphire Reserve](https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/sapphire/reserve) will not only protect you against fraud, but also protect you against accidental damage. When we bought our [LG GX 65](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65gxpua-oled-4k-tv) I cracked it when wall mounting it. Chase replaced the TV for us under their accidental damage policy (Caps out at ~10k.) Lower tier cards like Chase Sapphire Preferred can offer up to ~1k in accidental damage as well.\n\n(Aside: Save yourself some pain, never try to wall mount a large OLED yourself – [Replacing the display is more expensive than buying a new tv.](https://homeguide.com/costs/tv-repair-cost))\n\n### Sources\n\nMany of these I've used at home or tried first hand, but here are some other places I found a few things:\n\n- [Unique Accessories For Your Desk Setup! ~ Work From Home Edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4tAsGzf2lE) – [minimalistik](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZv7dyFdg4DIph6TIBlaVSQ)‍\n"

We have such a long way to go towards representing the incredibly diverse and special population of the world – this is the first leg of the race, not crossing the finish line. I'm so incredibly proud of this team can't wait to see this product evolve over time.</p><p>My goal being at Facebook has always been to bring a bit of joy and fun into the world, and I hope this does that even a little for people.</p>"

  body: "*Chapter Two —*\n\nNothing is more discouraging than not knowing why you feel so bad. You feel great for weeks at a time and then out of the blue life suddenly feels meaningless.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a mental health professional. I am an individual with experience dealing with depression, and these are some of my thoughts and a few of the things I did that help me in my situation. I recommend for anyone struggling with serious mental health issues to [talk with a counselor](http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/how-to-find-therapist) about their situation before following any advice given by others.*\n\nFixing things on my own is something I have always done. So inevitably when I ran into troubles with my mental health I thought I would be able to deal with them on my own. I didn’t realize at first what I was dealing with. I thought I was just a sleep-deprived design student. I thought that everyone felt so tired they could hardly get out of bed every morning, or turned in assignments late and missed classes because they couldn’t bring themselves to leave the house that day. I thought that some days feeling like life wasn’t worth it was just part of being a human being. I was wrong.\n\nI followed her advice and met with someone to discuss my struggles with depression and anxiety. It felt great to talk with someone that understood the things I was struggling with; someone that wouldn’t judge for feeling bad dispite having opportunities, a good job and a great school. But what I didn’t understand was that depression isn’t something you fix overnight. I walked out of that door feeling amazing–feeling like I was ‘fixed’.\n\nWhat I didn’t realize is that dealing with depression is a process, not an illness you get a few pills for and move on.\n\nI ended up spiraling into the lowest state of my life only a few months after those first few meetings. It took time and effort, with support and encouragement from others for me to get to where I am today.\n\nDepression is a **black hole**, a terrifying snowball of emotion that makes the world seem monochromatic and lifeless. And while it is terrible to live with, the most awful part is that it can strike without any notice. Anything can be a trigger, and suddenly you are back at the bottom of the well in darkness, looking up at a small spot of light somewhere far above you.\n\n*Every person’s depression is different.* It’s a terrifying uniqueness that makes these feelings difficult to even talk about with others suffering with similar symptoms. This isolation itself leads to even worse symptoms as thoughts [ruminate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumination_(psychology)). Depression is hard to discuss as an all encompassing illness or state of mind, depending on how you want to define it.\n\nTo learn how to break the cycle we must consider what makes us feel good. A sense of accomplishment, eating good food, exercise, and varying amounts of interaction with people (depending on in one is an introvert or extrovert.) All of these are things that often make us feel good. Putting on nice clothes or going out for a walk may help when feeling down. But those are only temporary solutions. How to do we break out of this difficult and seemingly endless loop?\n\nHere are a few things to get started:\n\n* **Identify thought patterns**. *What thoughts repeat before a particularly tough spiral of depression? Thoughts about finding a job or completing work on time? Feelings of being overwhelmed by all the tasks to do? Identify if these patterns repeat over and over. This process is called rumination, and is one of the large contributing factors to relapses into depression. By identifying the thought patterns that act as triggers it is possible to stop those processes before they cause damage. Break the cycle by considering what can be controlled in a situation. Discard what cannot be controlled and focus on impacting that which can. [More on rumination](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2014/02/16/8-tips-to-help-stop-ruminating/).*\n* **Accept failures.** *The worst thing about failure is not the failure itself, but the notion that it brings that failure is inevitable. Don’t let failures become a captor. Accept the failure and think about what caused it. Failure is the first of many steps towards success.*\n* **Share with others**. *Talk with people that are comfortable. Talk about feelings and fears, and about their experiences. Learn from those that have struggled with similar situations. Don’t be closed to those who are looking to help. Opening up can help the feeling of being alone or buried. With these feelings no longer feeling like a secret it will feel like a weight will be lifted off.*\n* **Set Goals, reward yourself**. *Find a simple goal for the day. Focus on achieving it. It doesn’t need to be grand or complex. Find something simple that can be achieved in a single day. Do that every day and the reward will be the empowering feeling of accomplishment and dedication.*\n\nThe key to surviving and breaking the cycle is to move forward one step at a time. A step backwards from time to time does not invalidate progress made. Find what works and stick to it, taking things a day at a time.\n\nDon’t worry about tomorrow, just get through today.\n\nYou are on your way to who you want to be."

(Image: Unsplash)</figcaption></figure><p>Note:&nbsp;The content is <strong><em>not</em></strong> intended to be a substitute for <strong><em>professional</em></strong> advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of a <strong><em>mental health professional</em></strong> or other qualified <strong><em>health provider </em></strong><em>for any health questions.</em><br></p><p>As someone who has a hard time disconnecting emotions from a situation I can relate closely to the example given at the beginning of Alison Wood Brook’s <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/12/emotion-and-the-art-of-negotiation\"><em>Emotion and the Art of Negotiation</em></a><em>. </em>In fact, the reason I decided to join a large company despite having skills that align better with a startup environment is I don’t like having to interact directly with clients. Negotiation and conflict are sources of anxiety for me personally, which is an emotion I try to avoid when possible as it has acted as a gateway into more difficult situations for me in the past.</p><p>I’m the type of person that is willing to pay more money for a service to avoid interacting with someone that cause a conflict. I often feel cheated in negotiations as I am not willing to attack the opposite parties footing to make them feel less comfortable to get myself in a better position. At the same time I am not naïve–I understand often that I am being taken advantage of in these situations or will come out with a result that is less desirable for myself. Similar to some of the advice in the article, I attempt to familiarize myself with a situation and the people involved before I have to negotiate. I try to act comfortable and casual around those people so that I do not make myself anxious, and if necessary bring in an expert to negotiate in my place.</p><p>The section on “Preparing Your Emotional Strategy” in the article provides a useful overview of some of the steps to take when preparing for negotiation. Since in the past I have spent a fair amount of time avoiding conflict &amp; negotiation I will need to remind myself of these strategies as they come about again, as being able to navigate the negotiation is an important skill to have. I think it is often possible to reach a common ground in which neither party needs to feel that they have ‘lost’ the negotiation, and that by taking such an approach a connection can be made for further business and interaction. (Essentially, don’t burn your bridges.)</p><p><br></p><p>‍</p>"

As this is an art project I wanted to take a personal approach, exploring a topic that is important to me. The goal of the assignment is to use a dataset to create art. I struggled to find a dataset that would allow me to do exactly what I wanted, so I decided to use the data I found as a creative medium rather than to use it as a direction for my narrative.</p><p>The visual style of the piece was inspired by old technology. The dataset is from 1995, as well as the “glory days” of NASA are in the past as well. The movement of the map is designed after tape-based data storage, where data would be recorded as a tape was fed through the system.</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604ded44260c2c3828b64515_22d86625220422e9b44619000db9249e9e79e163-screenshot-2016-02-19-13.54.12.8b6ff64a31790288f1b061ccc4fe027a54591f84.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:1600px\"><div><img src=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/60453108a750bf32c24d79eb/604ded4dc2649aac95b09b69_a05cf50bbb7224a9f0d84f9e93b1e8963cee3196-screenshot-2016-02-19-13.53.28.8b6ff64a31790288f1b061ccc4fe027a54591f84.png\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" loading=\"auto\"></div></figure>"

  body: "<p><em>Chapter Three —</em></p><p>There is a universe of brilliant ideas locked inside the mind: The next billion dollar product, a cure to cancer, or even the newest experience that makes a life a little easier. But those ideas are useless if they remain inside.</p><p>In high school I studied journalism quite extensively. In my junior year I headed yearbook production as Editor-in-Chief and did the layout for the majority of the school’s newspaper. At some point between the start of my senior year and graduation, however, I decided not to pursue journalism, but design. Throughout my high school career, I made a lot of things. When entering university, however, I shifted my focus creating to learning.</p><p>I spent all my time spare time discovering. I learned HTML &amp; CSS, I followed all the latest designs on Dribbble and coded my own widgets on Codepen. If there was a new technology I was probably digging into it to learn how it worked. I thought I had become an expert in many things. It felt great to know so much, and to hold the attention of my peers. But as I started seeing people who knew less than me produce better work, I was stunned. That’s when I realized I was missing something.</p><p>I was satisfied with learning <em>how</em> to make things, but never actually made anything.</p><p>Yes, now I could write code in 10 software languages, create games in JS, Unity and Unreal, work in multiple 3D softwares and can build with Arduino and Pi, but what do I have to show for all of these things? Not a whole lot of anything. I’m not suggesting that learning is not important, but taking the next step to making is equally important.</p><p>Don’t fall into the same trap that I did.</p><p>Get out there, stop thinking and just <strong>make something</strong>.</p><p>Make something to show friends, family, coworkers and even people on the street.</p><p>Ideas don’t have to change the world. If they do, that’s terrific, but in the meantime, learning happens. Every mockup created, and every idea brainstormed is another step of the journey.</p><p>Keep making until there’s an idea to fall in love with. Then keep making after that. Teach others how to make, so that the next generation won’t miss this important lesson either.</p><p>Don’t just make things. Finish things. It doesn’t have to be an entire social media platform or an RPG-scale game, but finish what it, and package it so that it’s something to be proud of. Going half way doesn’t count.</p><p>With each completed project, skills improve. People start taking notice, and listening to your ideas. Not every idea will be a success, but don’t let that be a hindrance . Keep making, and don’t stop learning either. Finding balance between the two is the key to making great things.</p><p>So, get out there and make something great!</p>"

  body: "<p>[Adapted from an internal Facebook note, light edits Mar 8, 2021]</p><p>Hey Ya'll – I wanted to give some insight into the process of what we do on recruiting trips, the climate of some of the design programs out there and how we can support the most junior designers out there to improve their chances of getting in and in general to support the industry.<em> </em></p><p><em>There is some great discussion going on about how we can help upcoming designers in this quip: </em><a href=\"https://fb.quip.com/jDcvAMVBsdJr\" target=\"_blank\"><em>https://fb.quip.com/jDcvAMVBsdJr</em></a><em> If you would like to get involved in planning how we can support new and upcoming designers with resources jump in to the conversation and I’ll hopefully set up some working groups soon!</em></p><h3>Overview</h3><p>York/Sheridan Design a design program in Toronto, originally focused on print/graphic design but has been incrementally moving towards interaction/product, with us seeing a few hires a year out of the program currently and growing. We do these trips every year to do general PD recruiting, to temperature check on program content &amp; direction and to build up future leads. I like to stay involved with the program to help them direct students interested in product and help shape direction of the new courses they are adding. It is also nice to have someone that went through the same program they are taking that is working in the field to ask questions and get advice from. We are seeing some exciting new trends this year, especially with students being interested in product far earlier than in the past.<br> </p><h3>Trends</h3><p>This year we are starting to see a bunch of new trends, a few good and a few not so good. Deltas are compared to last year and the year before.<br> </p><h3>Improvements:</h3><ul><li>We are seeing significantly more students interested in Product Design as a career path, particularly first and second-year students.</li><li>This is really exciting/valuable since one of the main problems when trying to hire students is they start exploring product end of 3rd year/beginning of 4th year, which is too late to build up the type of experience it takes to make it into companies like FB</li><li>If we want this to flourish we need to find a way to expose some learning paths that help distill out some of the noise when it comes to learning paths &amp; tools</li><li>Students are far more aware of VR/AR/3D design - they see these as important technologies that will influence designer's paths going forward but are unclear how it affects them now/what they should be learning</li><li>Students are using more and more industry standard tools (didn't see any students working in PS this year (all in sketch), saw lots of origami &amp; invision, a bit of framer and principle)</li></ul><h3>Student Weaknesses:</h3><ul><li>Students still tend to struggle with creating a body of work – get distracted by refining their presence, don't know how to balance their time, focus their efforts on designing (and coding) their own sites.</li><li>In portfolio reviews this one really stood out - I had to tell multiple students to stop redesigning their site for the X time when only having 3 projects on it (often the most recent over a year old)</li><li>All but the strongest students don't seem to understand how to self-initiate projects to expand their body of work</li><li>Weak process continues to be a trend, specifically for the weaker half of the portfolio reviews</li><li>Not understanding how to properly analyze the work being done around projects they are doing, how to borrow existing patterns &amp; extend them</li><li>Not knowing how to go wide properly, speeding to deep execution without exploring beyond one idea and a few throwaway sketches</li><li>There is a struggle to understand what to prioritize–they don't understand visual design, product thinking are the most important things for them to focus on.</li><li>Many students feel like they need to learn code to have a chance at tech companies (part of this is informed by seeing peers that get these jobs have significant coding experience)</li><li>Visual design seen as more of a focus for 'traditional' graphic design jobs</li></ul><h3>Infrastructure Weaknesses:</h3><ul><li>There are a lack of opportunities to spark additional work beyond coursework (having to apply to hackathons, lack of school-run events)</li><li>Still a lack of courses relevant to product design.</li><li>Not a lot of effort to help students how to act on research - they understand research is important and do it but don't know how to pivot based on the results effectively</li><li>No classes focused on specific topics in product (visual design, prototyping, patterns, etc) All classes are more generalist</li><li>Lack of directional guidance for students wanting to work in specific roles (print, product, advertising, etc)</li></ul><h3>What Can We Do?</h3><p>Here are some directional thoughts on ways we could support students better &amp; resources we could generate<br> </p><ul><li>Q&amp;A product for students</li><li>Less focused on wiki like answers</li><li>Answer some of the most common questions students have</li><li>Multiple answers from employees – X &amp; Y might have slightly different answers but it helps give a more human feel and a more believable perspective.</li><li>develop loosely defined tracks (maybe w resources links?)</li><li>Don't be too prescriptive, want to allow students to wander on their paths</li><li>Use this as a place to shut down common misconceptions (i.e. <em>not all product designers need to code</em>)</li><li>Provide a few tracks for people to explore (Product designer, motion designer, product manager, etc?)</li><li>Student focused section of <a href=\"https://l.workplace.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffb.design%2F&h=AT30coizqWBZOkOMS9Z02W_XdBdJNQ6t-b-mnnBRtQ2f1WD16LqV3q7SUlTLdEaKxygpLKG9-Emm_mRQi1oXIqtxlKJchInp03MH6OGvx6yFJjIqibzIPfEwrC9sEpdUYrf4dL6gcrEEy2MoeH8m-Q\" target=\"_blank\">fb.design?</a></li><li>Focused area of the site on resources for students</li><li>Can be used to help supplement weaker programs</li><li>plug into fb university work?</li><li>Helpful to empower people who can't afford school/don't have access</li></ul><p>Let me know if you are interested in contributing to building out resources for students, I'd be happy to connect you to relevant parties or get you involved in some of these brainstorms.</p><p><em>There is some great discussion going on about how we can help upcoming designers in this quip: </em><a href=\"https://l.workplace.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffb.quip.com%2FjDcvAMVBsdJr&h=AT0yTQ3l9TYOUIGBUjmpC0eZfkl1J1R4t7Xf6pDGTd1aRyZ8ohU7HKxenfwR4wms8SxRVDUygyOgGzNdeETgwjYXianpmpSwNc3CAF9EECeMkvIlnpoOyf5QAEkxztGBD1ZkwP6FbUBzfpn1Ld6gFw\" target=\"_blank\"><em>https://fb.quip.com/jDcvAMVBsdJr</em></a><em> If you would like to get involved in planning how we can support new and upcoming designers with resources jump in to the conversation and I’ll hopefully set up some working groups soon!</em></p><p>‍</p>"

  body: "<p><em>Chapter Four —</em></p><p><em>In a world of design superstars it is easy to underestimate one's skills by misunderstanding the difference between talent and experience.</em></p><p>In my second year of university I had fallen in love with <a href=\"http://fantasy.co/\">Fantasy Interactive</a>. I was just getting into web in a big way for the first time, and they were doing some of the hottest work out there. I remember the day they released the new USA Today site. I was blown away that they could make a news site so look so great. The interactions that they were coming up with were unlike things I had seen anywhere else on the web. I wanted to be them. I wanted to work there so badly. I remember going up to Anton Repponen to ask about internships. I don’t even remember what he said, all that mattered is that I had talked to him in person.</p><p>I didn’t wake up until I was given this advice from a friend: “Don’t fall in love with your idols. They just have had more time to work at it.” I had never really thought about the people behind the design that I had fallen in love with. Many of the people I look up to have been in the industry for ten years or more. Of course they have had more time to polish their skills. It can be hard to see that when looking at a fine crafted case study or newly launched site, but each of those designers came from the same place. They had to build up their skills over time.</p><p>While beginning the journey into the world of design it is inevitable to find designers to idolize. These discoveries can be creative fuel, but can also be a trap. Looking up to a designer without realizing that they just have more (or different) experience may make it seem like getting to the same point is unobtainable.</p><p>It is easy to fall into the trap of devaluing one's own work when constantly comparing with others.</p>"

  edit: "2021 edit: This work was done in my design school years in 2016 for a class called Research in Design, before I had lived in the area, and while I was far less educated and far more naive... The idea of an app being the salvation of the housing crisis here, and general remarks on gentrification, are not things I would make today. I think it is still worth looking back on these though, as they are a still of where I was at this point."

  body: "## The Concept\n\nInspired by a project a friend did recently about a display that reacts to your music, I started exploring *mixblocks*–A creation & remix tool focused around collabrative creation through the sharing of 'blocks.' While Mixblocks has a feed of creations that you can grab and remix from, it has no likes, no connected identites, and no custom user names. \n\n## Joining Mixblocks\n\nWhen joining mixblocks a creator is assigned a randomly generated name & profile image, which they can regnerate any amount of times. This generated name becomes the pseudonym that they create under. Starting from the very beginning of the process, mixblocks is focused on creation and not social presence or clout.\n\n(Insert intro flow here)\nCaption: The new person flow for mixblocks is focused on geting you in and creating as soon as possible. You can only create an account with your phone number or a secure auth service like Apple authentication. Mixblocks wants to know as little about you as possible.\n\n## Your First Block\nDropping into the app for the first time you will walk through creating your first block. This can be a lightblock or a sound block, but you have to create something to enter the rest of the app. You can walk through your first app guided (think the first level of Sound Shapes) or choose to jump straight into creation.\n\n## Remixing & Sharing\n\n## Importing & Exporting\n\n## Beyond Digital\nTake your blocks and run with them – Mixblocks is built from the ground up for use with hacker and maker tools like arduino, LED Matrixes, etc. Write your own custom integrations, or grab from one that already exists.\n\n"

  summary: "Learn, create & remix with light and sound. mixblocks lets you create small, open source blocks that anyone can use to make creations, license free–with a focus on physical output to displays like LED Dot Matrices."
