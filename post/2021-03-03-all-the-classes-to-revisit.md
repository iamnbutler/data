You know that thing you do when you get super hyped to learn something, open a million youtube videos, buy a class, get one session in and then completely move on? I do this a **lot**. This is a way to remind myself of all the cool things I've started that I forgot about or never went back to – and maybe (hopefully) let someone else know they are not alone in not being able to sit through a class!
