Been working on a lot of decks recently, and one problem I constantly run in to is finding great images and video of a person doing more than one thing for people stories. A few stock sites will have multiple shots in a series, but never many different activities, with a mix of video and photos, with a consistent person or set of people.

Style is another huge thing. It is hard to find content that feels less canned than stock photos, and feels more like what you would see naturally posted on our platforms.

I'd love to see us commission or shoot ourselves a series of these people for use when building a variety of products. (This would also help us get away from using employee's faces in our work.)
