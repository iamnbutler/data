Today we shipped a version of the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) site to line up with the beginning of our developer alpha and the initial release of our docs. Not much of the docs is publicly facing yet, but it's exciting to be putting up a taste of what is to come for everyone.

We also shipped a public [feedback repository](https://github.com/zed-industries/feedback/issues) for those with access to Zed to report issues.

I haven't got to post much yet about working on Zed, but I'm excited to start doing so more soon as things shape up!
