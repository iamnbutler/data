<p>[Adapted from an internal Facebook note, light edits Mar 8, 2021]</p><p>Hey Ya'll – I wanted to give some insight into the process of what we do on recruiting trips, the climate of some of the design programs out there and how we can support the most junior designers out there to improve their chances of getting in and in general to support the industry.<em> </em></p><p><em>There is some great discussion going on about how we can help upcoming designers in this quip: </em><a href="https://fb.quip.com/jDcvAMVBsdJr" target="_blank"><em>https://fb.quip.com/jDcvAMVBsdJr</em></a><em> If you would like to get involved in planning how we can support new and upcoming designers with resources jump in to the conversation and I’ll hopefully set up some working groups soon!</em></p><h3>Overview</h3><p>York/Sheridan Design a design program in Toronto, originally focused on print/graphic design but has been incrementally moving towards interaction/product, with us seeing a few hires a year out of the program currently and growing. We do these trips every year to do general PD recruiting, to temperature check on program content &amp; direction and to build up future leads. I like to stay involved with the program to help them direct students interested in product and help shape direction of the new courses they are adding. It is also nice to have someone that went through the same program they are taking that is working in the field to ask questions and get advice from. We are seeing some exciting new trends this year, especially with students being interested in product far earlier than in the past.<br> </p><h3>Trends</h3><p>This year we are starting to see a bunch of new trends, a few good and a few not so good. Deltas are compared to last year and the year before.<br> </p><h3>Improvements:</h3><ul><li>We are seeing significantly more students interested in Product Design as a career path, particularly first and second-year students.</li><li>This is really exciting/valuable since one of the main problems when trying to hire students is they start exploring product end of 3rd year/beginning of 4th year, which is too late to build up the type of experience it takes to make it into companies like FB</li><li>If we want this to flourish we need to find a way to expose some learning paths that help distill out some of the noise when it comes to learning paths &amp; tools</li><li>Students are far more aware of VR/AR/3D design - they see these as important technologies that will influence designer's paths going forward but are unclear how it affects them now/what they should be learning</li><li>Students are using more and more industry standard tools (didn't see any students working in PS this year (all in sketch), saw lots of origami &amp; invision, a bit of framer and principle)</li></ul><h3>Student Weaknesses:</h3><ul><li>Students still tend to struggle with creating a body of work – get distracted by refining their presence, don't know how to balance their time, focus their efforts on designing (and coding) their own sites.</li><li>In portfolio reviews this one really stood out - I had to tell multiple students to stop redesigning their site for the X time when only having 3 projects on it (often the most recent over a year old)</li><li>All but the strongest students don't seem to understand how to self-initiate projects to expand their body of work</li><li>Weak process continues to be a trend, specifically for the weaker half of the portfolio reviews</li><li>Not understanding how to properly analyze the work being done around projects they are doing, how to borrow existing patterns &amp; extend them</li><li>Not knowing how to go wide properly, speeding to deep execution without exploring beyond one idea and a few throwaway sketches</li><li>There is a struggle to understand what to prioritize–they don't understand visual design, product thinking are the most important things for them to focus on.</li><li>Many students feel like they need to learn code to have a chance at tech companies (part of this is informed by seeing peers that get these jobs have significant coding experience)</li><li>Visual design seen as more of a focus for 'traditional' graphic design jobs</li></ul><h3>Infrastructure Weaknesses:</h3><ul><li>There are a lack of opportunities to spark additional work beyond coursework (having to apply to hackathons, lack of school-run events)</li><li>Still a lack of courses relevant to product design.</li><li>Not a lot of effort to help students how to act on research - they understand research is important and do it but don't know how to pivot based on the results effectively</li><li>No classes focused on specific topics in product (visual design, prototyping, patterns, etc) All classes are more generalist</li><li>Lack of directional guidance for students wanting to work in specific roles (print, product, advertising, etc)</li></ul><h3>What Can We Do?</h3><p>Here are some directional thoughts on ways we could support students better &amp; resources we could generate<br> </p><ul><li>Q&amp;A product for students</li><li>Less focused on wiki like answers</li><li>Answer some of the most common questions students have</li><li>Multiple answers from employees – X &amp; Y might have slightly different answers but it helps give a more human feel and a more believable perspective.</li><li>develop loosely defined tracks (maybe w resources links?)</li><li>Don't be too prescriptive, want to allow students to wander on their paths</li><li>Use this as a place to shut down common misconceptions (i.e. <em>not all product designers need to code</em>)</li><li>Provide a few tracks for people to explore (Product designer, motion designer, product manager, etc?)</li><li>Student focused section of <a href="https://l.workplace.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffb.design%2F&h=AT30coizqWBZOkOMS9Z02W_XdBdJNQ6t-b-mnnBRtQ2f1WD16LqV3q7SUlTLdEaKxygpLKG9-Emm_mRQi1oXIqtxlKJchInp03MH6OGvx6yFJjIqibzIPfEwrC9sEpdUYrf4dL6gcrEEy2MoeH8m-Q" target="_blank">fb.design?</a></li><li>Focused area of the site on resources for students</li><li>Can be used to help supplement weaker programs</li><li>plug into fb university work?</li><li>Helpful to empower people who can't afford school/don't have access</li></ul><p>Let me know if you are interested in contributing to building out resources for students, I'd be happy to connect you to relevant parties or get you involved in some of these brainstorms.</p><p><em>There is some great discussion going on about how we can help upcoming designers in this quip: </em><a href="https://l.workplace.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffb.quip.com%2FjDcvAMVBsdJr&h=AT0yTQ3l9TYOUIGBUjmpC0eZfkl1J1R4t7Xf6pDGTd1aRyZ8ohU7HKxenfwR4wms8SxRVDUygyOgGzNdeETgwjYXianpmpSwNc3CAF9EECeMkvIlnpoOyf5QAEkxztGBD1ZkwP6FbUBzfpn1Ld6gFw" target="_blank"><em>https://fb.quip.com/jDcvAMVBsdJr</em></a><em> If you would like to get involved in planning how we can support new and upcoming designers with resources jump in to the conversation and I’ll hopefully set up some working groups soon!</em></p><p>‍</p>
