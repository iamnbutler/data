## Concepting out a custom, watercooled PS4

I had every intention of making this a reality! Once I found out about the PS5 coming I decided to put this project on hold and work on one for the next generation :) Of course, getting ahead of myself, I have many of the watercooling parts already ready to go in a drawer in my office...

Fist concept sketches in Procreate on iPad.

Started working on doing some higher quality drawings. Technical drawing is so cool to me – It's a skill I would really love to learn eventually.

I pulled apart my PS4 to get a better understanding of the sizes of the parts that I would need to design around. There isn't a lot of wasted space, mostly just a cutout for the 2.5" HDD/SSD.

The actual GPU/CPU combo is tiny!

The most complete render I got to. My plan was to 3D print the metal parts, and cut the glass/acrylic myself. (Also, add a bunch of USB up front! Like the 4 front controller ports on consoles like the Gamecube.)
